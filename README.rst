Introduction
====================
The application was writed for job seekers who are in the process of constantly finding a job. The main purpose of creating the program was to save time by collecting daily vacancies from `source websites`_. The program allows you to receive collective information of preferences in the preferred profession in the pre-specified e-mail address in csv (xlsx).

Alternatively, if you are looking for a specific job, just run the code, write your preferred position, your email address, and get the information you need in your own csv email in just 2-3 minutes.
